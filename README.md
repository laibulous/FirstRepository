# FirstRepository

This repository contains some of my **early C++ practice programs**, created while learning programming fundamentals and basic problem-solving.

It serves as a **learning archive** of small console-based applications written during my initial stages on GitHub.

## Contents

The repository includes the following C++ programs:

1. **BMI Calculator**  
   - Takes user input for height and weight  
   - Calculates and displays Body Mass Index  

2. **Restaurant Menu & Bill Calculator**  
   - Allows selection of menu items  
   - Calculates the total bill based on user choices  

3. **Discounted Price Calculator**  
   - Computes final prices after applying discounts  
   - Simulates a simple pricing logic for a goods company  

4. **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**  
   - Console-based implementation  
   - Uses basic conditional logic
